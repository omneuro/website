          BIOS is envsions a new field of treatments that use data-driven insights from he nervous system to create a better, more targeted medicine. The cause of most natural bodily aliments are faulty signals sent from the brain that causes our organs and systems to malfunction, leading to disease.BIOS has developed neural interfaces and AI that can read and write the body's neural data to understand and correct those signals in real-time.

          CRTL-Labs recreates the "0s and 1s" of neurons by listening to muscle twitches. They send the signals into machine learning algorithms to decode a person's intentions. This network is fed back to the wearer to create a symbiotic relationship. CRTL-Labs does all of this with a wristband.  (recently accuired by facebook In September 2019)

          Think of the moive "surrogates", thats exactly what Meltin MMI aims to accomplish. The company describes itself as "developing Cyborg Technology that connects bodies with machines".It's products examine biosignals to produce highly accurate real time analyses of body movements. The cyborgs can be oerated by a human user wearing the robotic devices or remotely, even from overseas, thanks to the MELTIN MMI servers. It is not currently brain controlled, however we can see the tragectory.

          Nectome's technology is developed to preserve human memory by studying how the brain physically creates memories.Nectome isn't just creating a BMI for the present. They're hoping to change how people "preserve the languages, cultures and wisdom of the past and how health care engages with individuals' memories and personal narratives." The only catch is, Nectome needs a living brain to caputre the memories. The procedure kills the patient.
